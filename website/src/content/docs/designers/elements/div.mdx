## Technical definition

Div is the most basic and flexible element which can wrap other elements, text and assets in it, or be empty and have visual properties to stand on their own.

By default the div in Jux is set to Flex with children aligned: `center`, justify content: `center`, and `80px` padding. 

The div element does not have default props but upon making it a component adding props is optional.
