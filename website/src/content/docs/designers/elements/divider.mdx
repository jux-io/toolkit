## Technical definition

The divider is not a formal HTML element, but frequently used in websites and web and native apps. Dividers allow users to separate between groups of objects easily.

## Anatomy and styling

In Jux - the divider element is very simply a div within a div. 

You can influence the styling of the divider line in relation to the divider element's state and properties by selecting them in the parent [context module](/designers/dynamic-design-panel/props-and-variants).

In case you want to add more children to the divider, you can hide some of the children in some of the states - using [display: none](/designers/dynamic-design-panel/layout)

If you add assets to your divider, you can change their content by using the ['asset content' property](/designers/editor/managing-assets)
