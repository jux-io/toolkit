## Technical definition

Text Element enables to add and edit texts on canvas and in components. Each text has its prebuilt content prop. In HTML, text is usually placed inside elements like **`<p>`** for paragraphs, **`<h1>`** to **`<h6>`** for headings, and **`<span>`** for smaller sections or inline text. These elements help structure the text on a web page.

## Props and states

The text object has a ‘text content’ prop which you can populate with any string, which will immediately be rendered on the canvas.

## Live mode

In live mode the text object is selectable (for copying for example).
