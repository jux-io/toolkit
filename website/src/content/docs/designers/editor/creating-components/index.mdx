**Components are reusable building blocks upon which UIs are built.**

Jux components  are categorized into two types, which are displayed as two separate tabs in the UI: Local Components and Library Components. Both types  are built as source components that can be reused with their instances. <u>Instances are updated automatically</u>.

Components are saved in the components panel, located in the editor's top navigation.

### Creating local components from elements

Jux elements are the fundamental units of every design system. Since they are HTML-based, they have the necessary functionality  to actually “work” in production. 

We recommend starting by styling [elements](designers/editor/elements) according to your brand and product requirements. When you place  **an element on the canvas, it will automatically become a Local Component.**

### Creating local components from scratch 

Build custom components and complex compositions:

1. Wrap multiple objects on the canvas with a div (shortcut: Shift+D)
2. Click "Create a component" in the top navigation
3. Your custom creation joins the Local Library

Once an object becomes a component:

- Interactive states and editable properties appear in the [Dynamic Design Panel (DDP)](designers/editor/dynamic-design-panel)
- Design child elements within the [context of their parent](designers/editor/dynamic-design-panel/props-and-variants) component

### Library Components

Elevate your Local Components to shared, organization-wide assets:

1. Select a Local Component
2. Click 'Add to library' in the top navigation
3. Watch the component indicator change from grey to blue for easy identification

Note: When you add a Local Component with nested instances to the library, those nested components automatically become new Library Components.

#### Sharing with developers

Only Library Components, along with all tokens and assets, are shared with your development team as part of the organization's design system.

### Nesting components

- Components (both local and library) can only be placed directly on the canvas
- When nesting a component inside a div or another component:
  - It's replaced with its instance
  - The source component appears on the left side of the parent object
- Instances of Library Components can be inserted into both Library and Local Components
- Instances of Local Components cannot be inserted into Library Components

This structure allows for flexible, modular design while maintaining the integrity of your shared design system components.
