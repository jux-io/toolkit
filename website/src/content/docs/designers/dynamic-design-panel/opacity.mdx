The opacity module controls the opacity of an object. It consists of a single field that accepts a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is fully transparent and 100 is fully opaque.

<CaptionImage caption="Opacity Property">
  <Image src={opacity} alt="Opacity Property" />
</CaptionImage>

<Badge text='Coming soon' />: The ability to tokenize the opacity field.
