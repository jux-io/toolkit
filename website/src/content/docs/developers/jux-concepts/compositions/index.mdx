Jux allows you to easily compose and extend styled components. This feature enables you to create specialized versions of components while maintaining a consistent styling base.

When you compose a component which has variants, they will be inherited by the composed component.

<CodePreview code={styledCompositionsRaw}><StyledCompositions /></CodePreview>

Jux `styled` function will work perfectly on all of your own or any other component, as long as they attach a `className` prop to a DOM element.

```tsx
const Button = ({ className, children }) => (
  <button className={className}>
    {children}
  </button>
);

const StyledButton = styled(Button, {
  color: 'violet'
})
```
