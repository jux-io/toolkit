### What is it?
The Div Element is your versatile container in Jux. Think of it as a flexible box that can hold and organize other design elements.

### How does it work?

- Container: Use it to group related elements together.
- Layout Tool: Arrange your design elements within the Div for structured layouts.

### Key Features

1. Pre-built Content Property: Each Text Element comes with a built-in content area, ready for your words.
2. Customizable: Style your text using the Dynamic Design Panel - change fonts, sizes, colors, and more.
3. Stucture-Aware: Behind the scenes, Jux understands the structure of your text (like headings or paragraphs), making it developer-friendly.

### Live Mode
In live mode, the Div behaves like any other web element:

- It maintains the structure and layout you've designed.
- Interactive states (like hover or focus) that you've designed can be viewed and tested.
- If you've added any interactivity or nested interactive elements within the Div, these behaviors will be fully functional and visible.

This real-world representation allows you to experience and refine how users will interact with your layouts and components in the final product.

While the Jux Div Element doesn't have default props, once you make it a component, you'll have the option to add and edit props and states.
