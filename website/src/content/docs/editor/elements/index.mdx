## What are Elements?

Elements in Jux are the fundamental building blocks for designing and implementing components in both your design system and production environment. These elements are more than just visual representations â€“ they are rendered code presented on the canvas, offering the full benefits of being programmatically defined.

### Key Features of Elements

1. Built-in Interactivity: Elements come with pre-defined interactive states and properties, allowing for a realistic design experience.
2. Live View: Observe real-time changes and interactions directly on the canvas.
3. Production-Ready: Easily edit and seamlessly integrate elements into your development workflow when working with developers.
4. Jux elements are unstyled web elements, which are the essential components used in modern web development.

### Advantages of Code-Based Elements
Using code-based elements provides several advantages over traditional vector-based design tools:

- **Realistic Interactions**: Elements like input fields, checkboxes, and toggles behave as they would in a real application, accepting user input and reflecting state changes.
- **Logical Awareness**: Elements understand their own state (e.g., checked/unchecked, on/off), allowing for more accurate prototyping and design.
- **Seamless Developer Handoff**: The code-based nature of these elements simplifies the transition from design to development.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that your design system elements match the behavior and appearance of elements in the final product.

By leveraging these powerful, code-based elements, Jux enables you to create more accurate, interactive, and developer-friendly designs, bridging the gap between design and implementation.

### Using Elements

Jux is constantly evolving, with new Elements being released and existing ones enhanced regularly. Each Element comes with predefined properties and design values that can be customized and tokenized directly on the canvas.

How to Use Elements:

1. Drag and Drop: Simply drag an Element onto your canvas.
2. Explore Behavior: Switch to live mode to understand the Element's interactive behavior.
3. Create a Component: Click the "Create component" button in the top right to turn your customized Element into a reusable component.
4. Customize: Use the Dynamic Design Panel (DDP) on the right-hand side to:
    - Select properties you want to modify
    - Test different values
    - Apply design tokens
5. Refine: Iterate on your design to perfectly match your product's design preferences.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create components that encapsulate your unique design language while leveraging the power and consistency of Jux's pre-built Elements.

### Logical Slot: Element Mechanics

The logical slot is a crucial component in the structure of Jux elements, serving as a container for element-specific logic.
