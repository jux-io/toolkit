### What is it?
The Text Element is your go-to tool for adding and editing text on your canvas and within components. Think of it as the digital equivalent of placing words on a page.

### How does it work?

- Easy Editing: Simply click and type to add or change text directly on your canvas.
- Flexible Formatting: Use it for various text types - from headlines to body copy.
- Component-Friendly: Easily incorporate text into your larger design components.

### Key Features

1. Pre-built Content Property: Each Text Element comes with a built-in content area, ready for your words.
2. Customizable: Style your text using the Dynamic Design Panel - change fonts, sizes, colors, and more.
3. Stucture-Aware: Behind the scenes, Jux understands the structure of your text (like headings or paragraphs), making it developer-friendly.

### Live Mode
In live mode, your Text Element behaves just like regular text - it displays your content without any special interactions. It's straightforward and true to what users will see in the final product.
