### Components: The Reusable Building Blocks of Your UI

Components in JUX are the reusable elements that form the foundation of your user interfaces. They come in two flavors: Local Components and Library Components. Both types are designed as source components that can be instantiated throughout your projects, with instances updating automatically to reflect changes in the source.

Find and manage your components in the dedicated panel within the editor's top navigation.

### Creating local components

#### From elements

JUX elements are the fundamental units of your design system, ensuring production-ready functionality. We recommend starting by styling [elements](/editor/elements) to align with your brand and product needs

#### From scratch

Build custom components and complex compositions:

1. Wrap multiple objects on the canvas with a div (shortcut: Shift+D)
2. Click "Create a component" in the top navigation
3. Your custom creation joins the Local Library

Once an object becomes a component:

- Interactive states and editable properties appear in the [Dynamic Design Panel (DDP)](/editor/dynamic-design-panel)
- Design child elements within the [context of their parent](/editor/dynamic-design-panel/props-and-variants) component

### Library Components

Elevate your Local Components to shared, organization-wide assets:

1. Select a Local Component
2. Click 'Add to library' in the top navigation
3. Watch the component indicator change from grey to blue for easy identification

Note: When you add a Local Component with nested instances to the library, those nested components automatically become new Library Components.

#### Sharing with developers

Only Library Components, along with all tokens and assets, are shared with your development team as part of the organization's design system.

### Nesting components

- Components (both local and library) can only be placed directly on the canvas
- When nesting a component inside a div or another component:
  - It's replaced with its instance
  - The source component appears on the left side of the parent object
- Instances of Library Components can be inserted into both Library and Local Components
- Instances of Local Components cannot be inserted into Library Components

This structure allows for flexible, modular design while maintaining the integrity of your shared design system components.
