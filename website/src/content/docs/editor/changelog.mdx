</CaptionImage>

## Version May 26, 2024

<img src={'/version202406.gif'} alt={'Version - May 2024'} />

**New Features**

- Introducing **Local** and **Library** components üéâ Once placing an element on the canvas it will automatically become a **local component**. Sharing components with developer is done only after adding that **local** component to the **library**. To add a component to the library, select it and click _‚ÄòAdd to library‚Äô_ (from the top bar). Learn more about the differences and behaviors of both here.
  - Local components and library components have different indication colors so it is easy to spot them on the canvas (Local are dark grey, Library are blue).
  - When adding local components to the library, all the nested items that are local components will be added to the library as well.
- All components (local and library) **are automatically updated.**
- Wrap with a div - select an item and click shift + d.

**Requested by the community**

* Editing text on canvas for both components and instances
* Rename object from the kicker  (yessss!)
* Share feedback - top navigation in the action menu on the right

**Improvements**

* New navigation UI - text and div elements are now stand alone buttons
  * Live-Edit moved to the top navigation
  * Panels behavior
  * New side navigation to switch between **Tokens** and **Editor**
  * Token management now has a new screen (to support upcoming Figma plugin)
* Assets panel item order by upload date
* Copy paste improvements. Copy of instances, components and assets
* Improved canvas performance (dragging elements & components smoothly)

**Bug Fixes**

1. Thumbnails preview bug, preview now shows the component with the default properties (first value of each property)
2. Deleting instances nested object is now blocked correctly
3. Dropping instances on the canvas with a click, now sets the instances on same location
4. Renaming ‚Äòprops‚Äô is now fixed and these ‚Äòprops‚Äô reach the developers code correctly
5. Delete object on canvas sometimes deletes other objects
6. Fit view, some of you reported that it didn‚Äôt work constantly

## Version April 10, 2024

**New Features**

**This one is for developers! üì£**&#x20;

CLI improvements: Instances now receive the selected props for complex objects. So for example if the designer would design a button with the following:

`hierarchy=‚Äòprimary‚Äô disabled={false}`

The code will reflect this just like you requested

* Edit properties and values

<CaptionImage caption={'Edit Props!'}>
  <Image src={editProps} alt="Edit Props!" />
</CaptionImage>

* You can add props, values and rename them both!
* These are also reflected in the CLI once the code is pulled

:::note
This is still not open for all users
:::

**Bugs Fixes**

* We had an issue with line hight for text objects, you can now set the line hight as you wish and it would reflect the correct hight. üéâ
* ‚ÄúComponents Preview‚Äù if you press the components menu (on the top Navbar) you will see there are a few thumbs for the components you have created, we now show the correct size and there are no strange sizes you didn‚Äôt like.
* Text styles are now saved and rendered even when changing the text in edit mode

## Version April 4, 2024

**Bugs Fixes**

* Copy/Paste now copies all the tree of design attributes of elements
* You can now change the value of the content of every texts everywhere üòá

## Version March 27, 2024

Its a small one, but wait to see what is cooking ü•ò

**New Features**

* Add any element, asset and component with a click from the menu - requested many times
* All elements now come fully with flex and auto so your design in much more responsive and intuitive
* All decimal points are now trimmed and rounded to 1 or 2 digits after the decimal point
* For the developers out there - there are new properties name for **checkbox** and **toggle**

**Bugs Fixes**

* Our DDP UI has been fine-tuned
* Gaps are now working properly when setting pixel values

## Version February 28, 2024

**New features**

1. **4 new elements to use off the shelf: (soon a page for each)**
    - Checkbox
    - Toggle
    - Radio button
    - Chip
2. **Variants is evolving and will streamline the design process:**
    - Elements and components can have now more than one property each.
    - Every element has a new built-in property to indicate if it is Disabled or not. The property can be set to true/false and is by default set to false.
    - Each Jux-element has its unique set of pre-built props (for example: Chip - Selected prop, Checkbox - Checked prop). These props are very common for developers to use and are used in our code once pulled.
    - Creation and editing of new props are coming soon!
3. **Parent-child context sub-module** - allowing to design the child while the parent is a specific variant with specific props values (for example: for checkbox, the parent, is unchecked and its child label needs to be in a different color. or if you want the button text to change color while the whole button component is in state - active)
4. **Display None** - Turns off the display of the selected object so that it is not seen and has no effect on the layout. Learn more about layouts in Jux [here](/editor/dynamic-design-panel)
5. **Finally**, we can **edit text on Canvas**! (We know the text box needs a few enhancements, we‚Äôre on it :)
6.  **Delete source component** from top left components panel. Please start by deleting the source component and its instances from the canvas, only then delete will be active.
7. **Shortcuts** (wohooo! :tada:)
    - **Undo** with command+z shortcut
    - **Delete** objects from the canvas with backspace
    - **Click drilling** works with command+click -> for selecting a specific child

8. **Styling capabilities**
  - **Shadow - first effect in the DDP!** You can find it in the effects module
  - Opacity

:::note
**Fun improvement**\
As requested, Div default size is now Auto (and since layout is display Flex - it‚Äôs so easy to start creating new components.)
:::

**Bugs fixes**

1. Copied elements that could not change the parent context are fixed
2. Decimal point for the opacity field is fixed

## Version January 18, 2024

**Features**

1. Tokens Management screen - we are now allowing you to edit with one click

**Bugs Fixes**

1. ‚ÄúUpdate component‚Äù was not shown at some places when adding a child node, removing child node, changing order, etc‚Ä¶
2. Elements & components tab had small area that make the floating window close instead of staying opened.
3. Canvas Fit-View now works great (try it out!)

:::note
**Fun Facts**

Once, you could have collapsed the universe by allowing to add the instance of a component into itself. It helped us travel back in time but it made too many issues for our users. So it is now block so the universe is safe and time travel is gone‚Ä¶
:::

## Version January 11, 2024

## Version January 4, 2024
