The opacity module controls the opacity of an object. It consists of a single field that accepts a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is fully transparent and 100 is fully opaque.


<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <picture>
    <Image src={opacity} alt="Opacity Submodule" width={563} />
    <Figcaption>Opacity property</Figcaption>
  </picture>
</div>

<Badge text='Coming soon' />: The ability to tokenize the opacity field is coming soon.
