The Effects module currently features one submodule focused on shadow properties. This submodule contains a composite field for shadow customization, which includes:

1. X-direction
2. Y-direction
3. Spread
4. Blur
5. Shadow color

All of these fields support tokenization for consistent design system implementation.
Additionally, the submodule includes a toggle button to switch between drop shadow and inner shadow effects.
