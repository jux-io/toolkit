### **Hey. We’re happy you’re here.**

Jux is a product design tool that enables product designers to design real interactive components, which can then be shared with a developer for immediate adoption in the codebase, eliminating unnecessary back-and-forth in the handoff process. Both designers and developers work in familiar environments - a canvas based for designers, and a CLI (command-line interface) for easy communication with Jux.

The documentation includes both developer and designer sections. If you can't find what you're looking for or if you have questions, join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/BSXsahmyVQ), or send a message to [squad@jux.io](mailto:squad@jux.io).

Interested in a user? Drop us a message, and we’ll send you an invitation.
