### **The problem**

Vectors have no inherent meaning in the world of code and distances, serving only as illustrations of the real world. As devs, we need to translate these vectors into real elements that computers and mobile devices can understand, which is where the problem starts.

The setup is repeated twice, managed on different platforms, and without the right tools, the process becomes a complete mess. Designers create vectors that are semantically called buttons, while developers have to recreate these elements in code, leading to duplication of effort, inconsistencies, and excessive back-and-forth communication. This widespread issue affects product designers and devs working with code across various industries and company sizes.

### **Jux**

Weâ€™re a code-based design tool that enables designers to design the product directly to production, integrating with the developer's codebase.

### **Why?**

Because youâ€™re juggling on the canvas instead of coding!

At Jux, our mission is to provide developers with a comprehensive library of UI components that adhere to industry-standard design patterns while prioritizing accessibility, customization, and ease of use. We recognize the challenges developers face in creating custom components on other libraries offered on the web - and aim to offer a solution that eliminates these hurdles.
Moreover, we empower designers to design these actual UI components as they will be used in developersâ€™ production environments, while developers can keep focusing on writing code, without going through long fix-up iterations to match the designer's expectations.

### **Key Features**

- **Weâ€™re not in Canvas anymore**: You donâ€™t need to enter the canvas every time and understand the designerâ€™s intention. Our UI components can be pulled on the CLI, **\_\_\_\_**
- **User-Friendly**: We prioritize developer experience, offering a fully-typed API and a consistent interface across all components for a seamless development experience.
- **Customizable**: With Jux, you have complete control over the styling of your components. Whether you prefer vanilla CSS, CSS preprocessors, or CSS-in-JS libraries, our components are designed to accommodate your styling preferences.
- **Accessible**: Our components adhere to established accessibility guidelines, ensuring that all users can interact with your applications seamlessly.
- **Modular and Open**: Jux components are pre-built with a modular architecture, allowing product designers to customize them on Canvas and enabling you to extend them to meet your specific requirements.
- **Incremental Adoption**: You can integrate Jux components into your projects incrementally, allowing you to add new components as needed without disrupting your existing workflow.
